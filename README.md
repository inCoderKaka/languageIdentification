# languageIdentification

This is for a case when a user records his voice and expects a python program to know what language he just used. This program lets you detect whether the language spoken by the user is english or not. Stay tuned for the updates where I will add more languages that it can detect.

To use the program all you have to do is run the program with the audio file same as the directory of this program.

For multipe files all in same folder, you need to specify the folder the files are in along with *.wav or whatever the format maybe !

Simple and easy to use. Enjoy !
